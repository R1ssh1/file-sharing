### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/R1ssh1/file-sharing.git
   cd flutter_file_sharing_app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Generate required files**
   ```bash
   flutter packages pub run build_runner build
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Platform-Specific Setup

#### Android
- Minimum SDK: API level 21 (Android 5.0)
- Required permissions are automatically handled by the app

#### iOS
- iOS 11.0+
- Permissions are requested at runtime

#### Desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- Full desktop support with native file system access

## üì± Usage

### Setting Up File Sharing

1. **Add Folders**: Use the "+" button to select folders you want to share
2. **Configure Permissions**: Set access control lists for each folder
3. **Start Server**: The app automatically starts a local HTTP server
4. **Peer Discovery**: Other devices on the network will automatically discover your shared folders

### Managing Requests

- **Automatic Approval**: Enable for trusted networks
- **Manual Review**: Review each download request individually  
- **Request History**: View all past requests and their status

### Security Features

## Protocol Overview

### Transfer Stream Framing
Each encrypted chunk frame: `[4-byte big-endian cipherLen][cipher bytes][16-byte GCM tag]`.

After the last encrypted frame a clear (plaintext) metadata footer is appended:
`[4-byte big-endian metaLen][JSON meta]` where JSON fields:
```
{"ver":1,"type":"final|failed|canceled","state":"completed|failed|canceled","hash":"<sha256-hex>","length":<plain_bytes>,"chunks":<count>,"sig":"<hmac-sha256>"}
```
`sig` = HMAC-SHA256 over the JSON without `sig` using key = SHA256(fileKey || 'footer').

Clients verify footer HMAC for authenticity and map `state` to local completion, cancel, or failure.

### Compression
If client sends `Accept-Encoding: gzip` and file size >= 8KB, the server gzip-compresses plaintext prior to encryption; header `Content-Encoding: gzip` is set. Hash is computed over original plaintext (pre-compression) ensuring consistent integrity verification.

### ACL Enforcement
Shared folders may define `allowedPeerIds` (whitelist) or `deniedPeerIds` (blacklist). Whitelist takes precedence: if present, only those peers succeed. Otherwise deny list blocks listed peers.

### Rate Limiting & Auth
Auth failures tracked per peer identity with lockout after repeated failures (HTTP 429 `auth_rate_limited`). Concurrent transfer caps enforced globally and per peer with 429 `rate_limited` JSON responses.

## Future Work
- Adaptive chunk sizing / congestion control
- Encrypted footer (currently signed only)
- Extended metrics & compression negotiation variants
- Full DI refactor and platform manifests
